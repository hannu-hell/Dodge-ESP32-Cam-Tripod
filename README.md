# Dodge-ESP32-Cam-Tripod
Dodge is an ESP32 Cam based novel tripod design.  Feel free to check out full build instructions on Instructables website - https://www.instructables.com/Dodge-ESP32-Cam-Based-Tripod/
You need to get the neutral positions for all servos set before uploading the code for Dodge to move correctly.  I have included an image with Dodge in its neutral position and the angles the servos should be at those positions.
Once done with setting the neutral angles the rest of the moves by Dodge will be calculated correctly.
